## Introduction

PicNotes is a web app that detects text in uploaded images and saves it as a note so that users can save it to Google Docs or other note taking apps. It utilizes the [Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) and a Python Flask server to serve image uploads and conversions. This project is still a work in progress, so more info coming soon!
